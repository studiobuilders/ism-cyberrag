# ISM Source Documents

This folder contains the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM), December 2025 edition.

These are the raw source PDFs before any parsing, chunking, or embedding. The ingestion pipeline reads from this folder to populate the Supabase vector database.

## Document Set

Files 01 through 25 are used. File 00 (the 255-page consolidated document) is not included because the individual guideline documents are more suitable for chunking and retrieval.
